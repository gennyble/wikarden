# Welcome to the Wikarden

A personal wiki. A home for my thoughts on the open web. It's an imperfect, experimental collection of notes, articles, and essays woven together into a net of knowledge and experience. You can read more about the concept of digital gardening {!here | garden-history}.

*The garden is still being designed and built- there is a lot {todo}- so there is not much here yet. The design and structure of this plot has taken heavy inspiration from {!XXIIVV wiki} which is a place I really do adore. You can read more about here, {here | meta}.*

Consider links to things in the garden to be ephemeral. Prefer to paraphrase (or quote directly) and link to {the garden's root | home}. Maybe provide some directions. Either way: encourage exploration.
