# Digital Garden

A digital garden is a personal wiki, a home for your thoughts on the open web. It's an imperfect, experimental collection of notes, articles, and essays woven together into a net of knowledge and experience. You can read more about what a digital garden is {!here | garden-history}.

*The garden is still being designed and built, so there is not much here yet. Inspiration is being taken from the {!XXIIVV wiki} for the style of this plot, but the backend is likely to be something entirely new. Read about the infrastructure behind this garden in the {meta}. Consider links to things contained in the garden to be ephemeral. Prefer to quote directly of paraphrase rather than linking. You could also link someone {home} and give them rough directions. Encourage exploration.*
