A personal wiki. A home for my thoughts on the open web. It's an imperfect, experimental collection of notes, articles, and essays woven together into a net of knowledge and experience. You can read more about the concept of digital gardening {!here | garden-history}.

Consider links to things in the garden to be ephemeral. Prefer to paraphrase (or quote directly) and link to {the garden's root | home}. Maybe provide some directions. Either way: encourage exploration.
