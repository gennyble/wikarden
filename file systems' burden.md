# File Systems' Burden

There's a perk of filesystems, though. They're pretty stable software. Wikipedia says it was first released in 1901 *squints* Wait, no, it can support dates as low as 1901. It was first released in late 2008. That's over a decade. Which isn't geologic, but it's pretty good. FAT32 was apparently released in 1977 and still exists today.

It's weird to think of file systems as software. I mean everything we interact with on these weird devices are software (is software? softwares), but I think of capital-s Software as things like VS Code, Firefox, Paint, etc.
