# Inputting Text With a Graphics Tablet
Instead of a clunky on-screen keyboard where you have to "peck" the letters in, what if you could just write them? Not OCR, that is hard and wasteful and doesn't work all that great. 

## The Surface
A 5x5 grid where you write. If you cross a cell with your pen, it's considered to be a part of the pattern. You draw here and not in Latin letters. It's a new writing system meant specific for interacting with your computer.

### English
At first it can have a few patterns for letters. A way to detect errors? H(o|u)ffman? You can set patterns? How? A percentage of the cell hit, maybe? Detecting user-defined patterns would be harder than programmed ones, I imagine, but maybe not? Why would it be?

### Toki Pona
I've yet to learn this lovely language, but I do seem to remember that it has less symbols than english. This is a good thing indeed. I think it's fit for this task.

### Stenography
Not to be confused with Steganography. It would certainly result in faster input of words. We can keep the current input in a space above the drawing input and let the user lowercase/uppercase or make edits as they wish. They should all have this, actually.
