# No Reason To Exist
The Existing Cube, name very much rough but I needed a filename, is a block of metal cut to precise, not-very-useful dimensions. Something like 1024x768x512 thou. Ideally that'd be precise to tenths of a though, too, so that point-zero has to be hit.

A cube of this size with sharp corners would probably hurt a bit to hold. It should have chamfers, but like, precise chamfers. Something like 10 thou deep, measured from the face of the bevel itself. That'd require a bit of math I bet.

Something that needs research is the expansion of the metal it'd be machined out of. I think copper would be neat, I like the metal, but I know it's not the easiest to work with.
