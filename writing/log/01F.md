# 01F

Hopefully I can get back into the swing of these after missing two, but we'll see if that's the case in two weeks.

Textual got some work. I improved how it collects statistics on how much data was sent. It sorts number of bytes sent by the value of the `Content-Type` header, which I thought was a neat idea. Other improvements include: General code cleanup, allow "colour" everywhere that "color" was accepted, general configuration improvements.

A new project! Uh oh. LastFM, if you don't know, is a service for tracking what music you listen to. It's been around for a good bit of time. So much time that there have been Open Source implementations of their protocol *and* the Android app I use to record my scrobbles (a listen is called a scrobble) supports one, GnuFM.

I don't want to use GnuFM, though, For a few reasons. The main one being that I simply want to write my own little server. So, that, I did start to do! It's called turquoise because I needed a temporary name while I thought up a better one and I get attached to things easily. Right now it fakes authentication and accepts Scrobbles and Now-Playings. You can see it at {{https://turquoise.nyble.dev}} if the server is live.

Lastly, I made a few improvements in here. Added a little section to {home} where I can put recent happenings. For now that's manual. Also! {doings} now where I'm just going to collect a list of all my projects. I would've liked to link to the Textual and turquoise sections, but currently my little generator is hugely broken!

I think this'll be the first one of these I tweet, so that's a little scary. Be nice, please. Tell me about any misspellings if you desire, but I'll probably leave them misspelled.

Thanks, and goodbye.
