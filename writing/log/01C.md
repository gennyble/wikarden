# 01C

Hooooookay it's 01D09 but *whatever I guess that's fine*. We're over halfway into 01D, so no goals. They feel kind of pointless with only a few days left. Anyway! What did I do in 01C?

Well! I went back and added notsure to {01B} because It was apparently created in that month. It very much feels more like it should be here, for some reason, but the data doesn't lie *(I hope)*. I need to be better about keeping track of what I do, like, on the day I do it. However that is very difficult. I will get better! Hopefully. I will try, anyway.

On the topic of notsure:
I reworked some drawing code so it's based on centers. I didn't want to do it but OpenGL's normalized coordinates kind of demand it. I might as well get accustomed to it. Or maybe I should learn Vulkan.

I wrote a little thing about conversation in this digital age. I'll move it into the garden shortly and modify this page to link it in.

Finally, I did a good bit of work on {!gifed}'s read API! I made a struct for the packed field in the Graphic Control Extension and added some rgb/rgba image structs which are returned by the `ImageIterator`.

Finally-finally *(that shouldn't have been finally, I missed a thing)*: I finally *(that's a lot of finally)* started writing my image viewer. It's designed first and foremost for GIF and anything else is an extra. It's called `give` and you can have a link when it's a bit further along.

Well, cya-round.
