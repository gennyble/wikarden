# 01A

Hello! It's a new year which is the *perfect* time to start doing a thing I've wanted to do. I'll be keeping a monthly journal here to keep track of the things I do.

I've started work on another tiny tool! This one's called shave. Shave removes an image's solid-colour border. It's particularly helpful when adding emotes to discord. Sometimes they have transparent borders and removing them makes them bigger and easier to see. Right now it can only do pngs that are rgb and rgba, but I want to add the other colour types and gif support soon!

Speaking of gifs, I've done some experimentation! It doesn't seem any decoder/viewer can handle gifs with a delay of 1. The delay in gifs is in hundreths of a second so that's 10ms and 100Hz if the delay is constant between frames (it doesn't need to be). Inconsistent delays are apparently just fine.

I didn't just play with images, though. I also stood up a Pleroma instance so I can look into the fediverse. I'm {!@gennyble@amble.dev} and not very sure if I'll do any posting there. Using a crossposter feels a little weird, really, so it'll probably be read-only for now.

Those're the things I did, mostly, so now some things I want to do.

A stable API for {!gifed} is always on this list, but I haven't done much lately. I'd like to implement a dithering algorithm because dithering seems really neat. Maybe some website work; I need to fix my little parser and get the entire website generated, not just the wikarden. Hopefully I can do a few of these before 01B.

Bye for now.
