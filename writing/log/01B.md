A short one this week!

I did *not* do a lot in the last fourteen days. Only two things, and not much, really. I started work on a Pleroma Frontend. I'm liking Pleroma so far, but the threading is less than stellar and it all feels a little cluttered. Plus I was looking for a little fun project.

It is HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS and I'm excited to get it working fully. All it can do now is load posts and descend into a thread. There's a little bit of funky with the way Pleroma gives statuses, so I'm not sure how clean I can really get it. Anyway, it looks promising.

The second thing was a little repository where I can play around with OpenGL. I was feeling kind of done-with-code so I decided to just start a thing I can fuck around and find out in. I hesitate to do that in more established places, possibly because I don't make much use of git's branches. Anywya, It's called notsure because I am notsure what it is. You can find it here on {!GitHub | notsure}.

Seeing as I didn't do a single one of my things from last month that I said I wanted to do in this, I will not be making new todos :)
