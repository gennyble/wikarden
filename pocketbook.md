# The Pocketbook is where things go to be remembered
Ideas that have yet to be realized or articles not-yet written. The pocketbook preserves them in memory so they can be later recalled.

## Morals of Digitizing Board Games

- The rules of the game should not be mandatorily enforced; you should be able to slip one by your opponent
- You should be able to change how the beginning of the game looks. Like changing the chess board pre game-start.
- It should be as if you were playing it in the real world, just on a computer. Everything should be possible that was previous, and now more. The digitizing of the game should be *extensive* and make the game wider, bigger. It should not limit you in what you can do.
