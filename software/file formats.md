I have a weird affinity for file formats, particularly {gif}.

## {GIF | gif}
GIF is a lossless image format that supports single, static images as well as animations. It's compression algorithm, LZW, is outdated and overall not-very-good. As much as I love GIF, it should be retired in favor of APNG and WebM for most situations as they tend to compress better.
