# Unreleased software
Software announced-not-yet

## Libraries

#### {{Gifed | https://github.com/gennyble/gifed}}
A Rust crate for **gif** **e**ncoding and **d**ecoding where you remain in control. Gifed provides an easy to use API while also allowing you to directly touch the bits that make a gif a gif.

#### {{Rawproc | https://github.com/gennyble/rawproc}}
Raw image file decoding and processing, mostly in Rust. Heavily related to easyraw.

## Binaries

#### {{Hext | https://github.com/gennyble/hext}}
A binary file markup language and compiler.

#### {{Sail | https://github.com/mademast/sail}}
An RFC compliant mail server.

Fun fact:
Did you know that in RFC 5321, the current latest for SMTP, there's a mistake in the ABNF. It makes `""` a valid mailbox user so something like `""@nyble.dev` is a valid email!
