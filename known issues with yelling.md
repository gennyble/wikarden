Yelling is our thing that makes this here website and it, uh, has issues! Allow me to detail them.
- Italic and bold has not yet been implemented. Mainly because it's really hard if you have `*` do them both, just in different counts. Thanks markdown.
- We're not escaping HTML *anywhere*
- Needs a refactor
