# Morals of Digitizing Board Games
A set of guiding principles that I think one should follow when bringing games into the digital world, from the real. They are rooted in one core belief: You should not limit what players can do. Digitizing the game should be extensive, making the game wider, not restrictive. Everything that was possible should still be possible, and maybe even more.

### The Rules should have a switch
You should be able to turn off the rules. Whether that's a global don't-police-me switch, or a more granular control.

Take this scenario:
You're playing chess with a friend. One of you thinks it could add a bit of spice if you make the knight move 2 and 2 instead of 2 and 1. The other one thinks "yeah, that sounds pretty cool" so you setup the game. You go into the rules and switch off knight policing or, better yet, you tell the computer that "Hey, these are the knights allowed moves".

### Modify the board at any point
Let players start how they want. All pawns knights or only pawns and a king.
