# Music With The Sun
An EPROM is programmed with a little tune. It's constantly read back by some kind of driver- An Arduino or an 8086?- and played through a little speaker. The cover over the quartz-glass window is removed as it's set in the sun. As the bits inside the EPROM flip, the tune is changed until it's eventually silent.
